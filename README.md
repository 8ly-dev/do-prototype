## Do, Task Management That's Innately You

**I'm Doing**

---

Do is the innate human task companion—where your intent becomes reality with less friction and more flow. We believe productivity tools should feel like an extension of your mind, not another system to manage. Do reimagines task management as a natural, intuitive experience that adapts to your rhythm, not the other way around.

### Our Vision

Current task tools overwhelm users with complexity. They force you to:

- Manually prioritize, schedule, and track tasks
- Juggle multiple apps for simple actions (email, lists, research)
- Sacrifice creativity and focus to rigid, robotic systems

**Do solves this by:**

- Eliminating friction between thought and action
- Embedding tools directly into your tasks (email, lists, research)
- Adapting silently to your shifting priorities, so you can focus on what matters most

### What the Prototype Demonstrates

Our prototype is a live demonstration of agentic AI for natural language task management. It showcases:

- **Project/Task Creation:** Start new projects or add tasks simply by describing what you want to do.
- **Project/Task Deletion:** Remove projects or tasks with a word or gesture.
- **Project/Task Listing:** See your work organized in a single, calming focus zone.
- **Contextual Task Types:** Tasks evolve as you do—email, reminder, or list—Do recognizes and adapts.

**Example Workflow:**
Type "Email Bob about potluck Sunday." Do creates a draft email, lets you edit and send it, then tracks Bob's reply and updates your shopping list—all without switching apps.

### What's Missing (and Why)

To protect privacy and keep the prototype focused, we've intentionally left out:

- **Email/Calendar Integration:** No sensitive personal data required for the demo.
- **Notifications:** Known technology, omitted to focus on core innovation.
- **Manual Management:** Do is about natural input; traditional management is planned for full release.
- **Authentication:** Security is essential for launch, but not for prototype demonstration.

### How We'll Expand

**Our roadmap:**

- **Phase 1:** Beta launch with email, lists, and priority management.
- **Phase 2:** Integrations with expanded integrations, notifications, and manual management.
- **Phase 3:** The full Do ecosystem for enterprise workflows.

**Planned Features:**

- Seamless email and calendar integrations
- Proactive, contextual notifications
- Secure authentication and privacy-first design
- Adaptive prioritization that learns from your habits
- Collaborative tools for teams, not just individuals

### Why Do?

- **No AI Branding:** Feels human, not robotic.
- **Actions Embedded in Tasks:** No more app switching.
- **Silent Reprioritization:** Adapts to your rhythm, not a rigid schedule.
- **Intent Input:** Your words become actions, instantly.

# Do & 8ly FAQ

## Team and Leadership

### Wouldn't the 8ly be stronger with a co-founding team?

You're absolutely right that diverse founding teams often bring complementary skills and perspectives. That's precisely why I'm actively seeking co-founders who share my vision of creating technology that feels innately human. As noted in the documentation, "Right now it's just me, Zech." I bring 20 years of coding experience and a Computer Science degree, but I recognize the value of adding co-founders with complementary expertise. Studies show that startups with complementary co-founding teams are more likely to succeed than solo ventures. While I'm building the foundation, I'm carefully seeking potential partners who align with my human-first philosophy rather than rushing this critical decision. The right co-founding team will help execute the vision more effectively and provide resilience through challenges.

### Do you have the AI/ML expertise required for this product?

While my background is in Computer Science with 20 years of coding experience, I recognize that specialized AI/ML expertise will be crucial for Do's success. That's exactly why finding co-founders or early team members with strong AI/ML backgrounds is a priority. Meanwhile, I've been deepening my knowledge in these areas. The initial prototype demonstrates my technical capability to begin implementation, but I'm transparent about needing to build a team with specialized expertise to fully realize my vision.

### How will you attract top technical talent in the competitive AI space?

Our advantage in attracting talent lies in our distinct vision. Unlike many AI companies focused on automation or efficiency, 8ly emphasizes "human-first technology" where AI works "silently in the background." This mission to create technology that "feels like a natural extension of thought" resonates with many top engineers tired of working on impersonal AI systems. Additionally, we plan to offer competitive compensation packages, emphasize work-life balance aligned with our philosophy, and provide meaningful ownership through equity. Our prototype already demonstrates technical feasibility, which helps attract those who want to work on products with clear potential.


### What happens if you burn out or face personal issues? Is there a succession plan?

This concern highlights exactly why building a strong co-founding team is my immediate priority. A well-structured founding team provides redundancy in leadership and reduces single-person risk. I'm documenting my vision, technical approach, and business strategy to ensure continuity. As we grow, we'll formalize succession planning and crisis management protocols. My personal experiences in management have taught me the importance of sustainable work practices and building resilient organizations that don't depend entirely on a single individual. This balanced approach to leadership is part of our "intentional living" philosophy.

### How will you balance technical development with business responsibilities?

This challenge is precisely why I'm prioritizing building a complementary founding team. In the short term, I'm taking a phased approach—focusing first on developing a compelling prototype that demonstrates our vision while simultaneously networking to find the right co-founders. As Liz Zalman points out in ["Founder vs Investor,"](https://startupnation.com/books/12-absolutes-of-fundraising-from-the-honest-truth-about-venture-capital-from-startup-to-ip/) co-founders who tag-team investor calls are significantly more effective at fundraising than solo founders. I've already created structured documentation of our vision, roadmap, and strategy to ensure clarity as we grow the team.

### Why should I believe you can execute on such an ambitious vision?

My 20 years of coding experience and Computer Science degree have equipped me with the technical foundation needed to begin implementing Do. What sets this apart from just another ambitious idea is that the vision emerged from solving real problems I've experienced personally with existing productivity tools. The prototype already demonstrates feasibility, showing that I can translate vision into execution. I recognize the scale of this challenge—that's why I'm seeking complementary co-founders and building relationships with advisors who have successfully scaled similar products. As Mike Mahlkow [notes in Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbestechcouncil/2025/03/14/what-founders-get-wrong-about-fundraising-and-how-to-fix-it/), investors don't fund ideas; they fund execution. My track record of completing complex projects, combined with our clear roadmap and phased approach, demonstrates our commitment to disciplined execution.

### Do you have any industry experts or advisors supporting this venture?

We're actively building our advisory network, focusing on individuals with expertise in AI/ML, UX design, productivity tools, and startup scaling. Our approach to advisors is quality over quantity—seeking meaningful engagements with experts who genuinely believe in our vision rather than collecting impressive names. As we formalize these relationships, they'll become powerful advocates when approaching investors.

## Market and Business Model Objections

### The productivity tool market is saturated. Why will users switch to Do?

You're right that the productivity market has many players, but it remains fundamentally broken for most users. Current tools force users to "manually prioritize, schedule, and track tasks," "juggle multiple apps for simple actions," and "sacrifice creativity and focus to rigid, robotic systems" as we note in our documentation. Do isn't just another task app—it represents a paradigm shift in how people interact with their tasks by eliminating the friction between thought and action. Our differentiator is making technology that feels "innately human" rather than adding to cognitive load. User research shows significant frustration with existing tools that require substantial manual management. By embedding action tools directly within tasks and enabling natural language input, we're addressing a persistent pain point that established players have failed to solve. The productivity market's size actually validates the opportunity—it's large enough that capturing even a small segment represents significant growth potential.

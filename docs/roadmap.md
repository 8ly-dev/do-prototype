## 8ly Roadmap Document

### **Vision & Philosophy**

8ly is a human company-its mission is not to create AI, but to empower people. 8ly’s products serve as force multipliers for human action: helping people take initiative, understand who they’re working for, and create workflows that move them forward. Every tool is designed to feel innately human, reducing friction between thought and action, and letting technology serve as a natural extension of intent-not a replacement for it.

## **Product Pillars**

### **Do**
*Do* is 8ly’s first product: a human-centric task management tool that integrates agents directly into people’s workflows. It enables users to express what they need to do in natural language and have it happen, minimizing the need for manual prioritization or juggling multiple apps.

**Key Features:**
- Natural language task creation (“Email Bob about potluck Sunday” creates a draft, tracks the response, and updates your shopping list).
- Contextual action tools: integrated email, lists, and research directly within tasks, so users never leave their flow.
- Proactive agents monitor social media, email, and calendar, preparing tasks and replies before users even see the events.
- Surfaces next actions, so users always know what’s important-no more hunting for projects or forgotten emails.
- Silent prioritization adapts to shifting priorities, surfacing urgent tasks as needed.

**Differentiators:**
- No AI branding-feels human, not robotic.
- Actions embedded in tasks; no context-switching.
- Adapts to user rhythm, not the other way around.

### **Connect**
*Connect* extends 8ly’s philosophy to communication. It aims to give people a cleaner, smarter inbox by integrating chat and email, transparently removing noise and surfacing only what matters.

**Key Features:**
- Combines chat and email into a unified, decluttered interface.
- Automatically moves requests, reminders, and events out of the inbox and into Do, so users can enjoy downtime and focus on work later.
- Converts communications into actionable tasks, events, and reminders-adding context and research as needed.
- Connect is for fun and connection, while Do is for work and action.

### **Surf**
*Surf* expands 8ly’s reach into users’ interactions with the web. It organizes what people are looking at, talking about, and searching for-putting every activity in the context of what’s been done and what needs to be done.

**Key Features:**
- Starts as a browser extension, surfacing relevant history, bookmarks, and context throughout 8ly’s ecosystem.
- Grows into a full browser, offering a clean, simple experience deeply integrated with Do and Connect.
- Extends to mobile and desktop, bridging the gap between web activity and personal productivity.

**Conceptual Model:**
- Surf = things
- Connect = people
- Do = actions

## **User Experience Principles**

- **Eliminate Friction:** Every tool and workflow is embedded directly in the user’s context-no app switching, no unnecessary steps.
- **Silent Prioritization:** The system adapts to user needs, surfacing what’s urgent and letting less important tasks fade into the background.
- **Natural Input:** Users interact in their own words; the system parses intent and takes action.
- **Privacy & Trust:** Minimal data storage, secure authentication (Google OAuth), and transparent handling of user information.
